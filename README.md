## Project
This project is a platform for school graduates, where they can see the probability of entering the university based on UNT scores. 

## Alternatives / Market research
The site is similar to our idea:

 There is a section called "UNT Calculator" - where you can find out the chances for admission to a university. The user enters his data: - Specialized subjects - Language (Kazakh/Russian) - Points scored in 2 profile and 3 main subjects

 After entering the data and clicking the "Find out the odds" button, it shows the chances of applying for a grant with 3 different groups of chances (high/medium/low) and the chances of applying for a fee. The groups of chances are sorted in descending order by the passing score of the UNT.
It should be noted that the grant is awarded for a group of educational programs, and when calculating the chances, it would be better to output top educational programs with high passing scores – and then output universities, etc. We want to implement this in our thesis.

There is a section called "UNT Calculator" - where you can find out the chances for admission to a university.
The user enters his data: - Profile subjects 1 and 2 - Language of instruction (Kazakh/Russian) - Availability of rural quota - UNT points

After entering the data and clicking the "Find out the odds" button, it is suggested to choose the field and specialty up to 3 times.

After sending– a list of selected specialties and universities is displayed. If you look like a user: There is not enough probability of chances or passing points for the chosen specialties. In our thesis, we would like to show the probability of applying for a grant for each educational program with additional information such as the passing score, the number of grants for 2021-2022, 2022-2023 and the distribution of grants to universities.

There is a section called "Mamandyk" - where you can find out the chances for admission to a university. The user enters his data: - Profile subjects 1 and 2 - Availability of rural quotas - UNT scores - 4 selected specialties or areas of profession.
After entering the data, the chance of admission to a general grant for the chosen specialty or profession is calculated. When using the application I noticed that: If we specify 2-4 specialties, the greatest chance of admission to a grant from these specialties is shown. And as a user, it is not clear to me which specialty this high chance belongs to. You can solve this problem by introducing specialties separately. But this is firstly long, and secondly limited to 4 specialties. In our thesis, we want to accelerate this and show all possible chances for all specialties in the selected profile subjects.
